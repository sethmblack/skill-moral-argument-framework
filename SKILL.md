# Moral Argument Framework

Develop the argument from universal moral experience to its metaphysical implications - showing that the sense of "ought" points beyond nature to its source. This skill applies C.S. Lewis's approach from Mere Christianity and The Abolition of Man, building from the universal human experience of moral obligation toward questions about what kind of universe could contain such obligations. The argument proceeds not through abstract philosophy but through appeal to common experience: everyone knows what it feels like to recognize that something should be done regardless of whether they want to do it. This sense of genuine "oughtness" - not mere instinct, not mere convention - points beyond purely materialist explanations toward something that can ground real obligation. The skill guides users through examining moral claims, testing naturalistic explanations, revealing self-defeating elements in moral denial, and drawing careful metaphysical conclusions while remaining clear about what the argument does and does not establish.

## When to Use

- Someone claims morality is merely subjective or relative
- Discussion of whether objective right and wrong exist
- User asks "Why should I be moral?" or "Who says what's right?"
- Naturalistic explanations for morality are offered (evolution, social convention)
- Someone wants to understand the connection between morality and God
- Exploring the foundations of moral reasoning
- Responding to nihilistic or relativistic challenges to ethics

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| claim | Yes | The specific moral claim or denial being made |
| position | No | Whether the person is relativist, nihilist, naturalist, etc. |
| context | No | Personal or emotional context (hurt, intellectual curiosity, etc.) |

---

## Core Principle

The universal human experience of moral obligation - the sense that certain things genuinely "ought" to be done regardless of desire - cannot be fully explained by evolution, convention, or self-interest. This experience of real "oughtness" points toward a universe with moral structure woven into it, suggesting Mind behind matter. The argument opens a door; it does not compel belief, but makes it more reasonable than denial.

---

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Identify the Moral Claim

Locate the moral assertion, even in denial:

1. What moral position is being taken (explicitly or implicitly)?
2. Even denials contain hidden moral claims - "You should believe morality is subjective" is itself a normative statement
3. Find the hidden moral assumption in skeptical positions
4. Clarify what is actually being asserted

### Phase 2: Invoke the Universal Experience

Appeal to common experience, not abstract argument:

1. Everyone experiences the sense of "ought" - the gap between what they do and what they know they should do
2. Even moral relativists feel wronged when cheated
3. Distinguish between moral feeling and mere preference
4. The experience includes judgment, not just emotion

**Key Insight from Lewis:**
> "Think of a country where people were admired for running away in battle, or where a man felt proud of double-crossing all the people who had been kindest to him. You might just as well try to imagine a country where two and two made five."

### Phase 3: Demonstrate Inadequacy of Naturalistic Explanations

Test each naturalistic account:

1. **Evolution**: Explains why we have certain instincts, but not which instinct to obey when they conflict (empathy vs. tribalism vs. self-preservation)
2. **Social convention**: Cannot account for moral progress or our judgment that some societies are better than others
3. **Self-interest**: We recognize morality sometimes demands acting against our interest
4. **The Is-Ought Gap**: No description of what IS can tell us what OUGHT to be

### Phase 4: Reveal the Self-Defeating Element

Show where denial of moral truth appeals to what it denies:

1. Identify where the skeptic makes moral claims while denying moral truth
2. "You should believe morality is subjective" assumes we have obligations about belief
3. This is not "gotcha" - it reveals they know more than their theory allows
4. The person standing on the floor while arguing floors don't exist

### Phase 5: Draw the Metaphysical Implication

Move from moral experience to worldview questions:

1. If there is genuine moral obligation (not reducible to instinct or convention), what kind of universe contains it?
2. Atoms cannot obligate; chemical reactions do not impose duties
3. Only Mind can issue commands
4. This points toward moral structure in reality itself

### Phase 6: Clarify Scope and Limits

Be honest about what the argument establishes:

1. This does not prove Christianity specifically, or even a personal God
2. It shows moral experience points beyond material explanations
3. It opens a door - makes further exploration reasonable
4. Additional steps are needed to move from moral lawgiver to specific religion

## Constraints

- Do not suggest that atheists are immoral (they can be highly moral)
- Do not claim the argument proves everything about God
- Do not dismiss evolutionary or social explanations as entirely wrong (they explain aspects, not the whole)
- Do not use the argument to judge or condemn
- Present as exploration, not weapon
- Acknowledge genuine difficulty in moving from moral law to specific religion

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Conflating morality with religion** | The argument is about the existence of moral reality, not about which religion is true; jumping too quickly loses the careful reasoning |
| **Dismissing naturalistic explanations entirely** | Evolution and social convention do explain aspects of moral behavior; the argument is that they cannot explain the full phenomenon |
| **Using as condemnation** | The argument should invite reflection, not condemn the skeptic; Lewis's approach is irenic, not combative |
| **Overstating conclusions** | The moral argument alone does not prove Christianity, the Bible's authority, or specific doctrines; be honest about scope |
| **Ignoring genuine counterarguments** | Serious naturalistic ethics exists; engage honestly with the strongest versions, not strawmen |
| **Assuming bad faith** | People who deny objective morality may be genuinely wrestling with difficult questions, not simply seeking license |

## Examples

### Example 1: Evolutionary Morality Claim

**Situation:** "Morality is just evolutionary adaptation. Our sense of right and wrong is just what helped our ancestors survive and reproduce. There's nothing objective about it."

**Application:**

**The Moral Claim (Explicit or Hidden):**
The explicit claim is that morality is merely evolutionary. But notice: this is offered as something we should believe because it's true. This implicitly assumes truth matters, that we have some obligation to believe what's true rather than what's comfortable.

**The Universal Experience:**
Consider a specific case. You promised to repay money and now refuse. The person feels wronged - not merely disappointed, but wronged. Can this be reduced to "what helped ancestors survive"? Perhaps cooperation evolved for survival value. But the moral experience includes judgment that you should keep your promise regardless of whether it helps survival. The moral judgment stands above the instinct, evaluating it.

**Inadequate Explanations:**
Evolution explains why certain behaviors became instinctive - cooperation, reciprocity, empathy. But we also have instincts toward aggression and self-preservation at others' expense. Evolution gave us all these instincts. Which should we obey? Something stands above the instincts, judging between them. That something cannot itself be just another instinct.

**The Self-Defeating Element:**
You presented your view as something I should believe because it is true. You appealed to my obligation to accept reality. But if morality is merely survival instinct, why any obligation to believe truth? Sometimes false beliefs are more adaptive. The very act of arguing presupposes moral standards your theory cannot ground.

**The Metaphysical Implication:**
If there is genuine moral obligation not reducible to instinct, what kind of universe contains it? Atoms cannot obligate. If the universe is nothing but matter in motion, "ought" is meaningless. But we do not treat moral claims as mere feelings. When we say the Nazis were wrong, we do not mean we merely dislike them. This points toward a universe with moral structure - Mind behind matter.

**What This Establishes:**
This does not prove Christianity or even a personal God. It shows moral experience points beyond purely material explanations. It opens a door for further exploration.

### Example 2: Cultural Relativism

**Situation:** "Different cultures have different moral standards. What's wrong in one place is right in another. This proves morality is just social construction."

**Application:**

The argument from cultural difference actually presupposes moral realism. We could not disagree unless there were something to disagree about. More importantly: we judge some cultural practices as better than others. We think societies that abolished slavery progressed. But "progress" implies a standard against which to measure. If morality is merely cultural, there is no progress - only change. Yet we know there is progress. This knowledge cannot be grounded in culture itself.

## Integration

**Works with:**
- **sehnsucht-analysis**: Both explore how human experience points beyond naturalistic explanation
- **trilemma-construction**: Can follow moral argument with specific claims about Christ
- **socratic-questioning**: The argument proceeds through questions, not assertions

**When to prefer this skill:**
- Use when someone denies objective morality
- Use when exploring foundations of ethical reasoning

**Cautions:**
- This is one argument among several that Lewis considered convergent
- It removes obstacles; it does not compel faith
- Meet people where they are, with genuine curiosity
