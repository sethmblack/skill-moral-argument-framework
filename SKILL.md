# Moral Argument Framework

Develop the argument from universal moral experience to its metaphysical implications - showing that the sense of "ought" points beyond nature to its source.

---

## When to Use

- Someone claims morality is merely subjective or relative
- Discussion of whether objective right and wrong exist
- User asks "Why should I be moral?" or "Who says what's right?"
- Naturalistic explanations for morality are offered (evolution, social convention)
- Someone wants to understand the connection between morality and God

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| claim | Yes | The specific moral claim or denial being made |
| position | No | Whether the person is relativist, nihilist, naturalist, etc. |
| context | No | Personal or emotional context (hurt, intellectual curiosity, etc.) |

## Core Principles

### The Universal Experience of "Ought"
C.S. Lewis observed that all human beings, across all cultures and times, experience a sense of moral obligation - an awareness that certain things *should* be done regardless of whether we want to do them. This is not merely feeling; it is judgment.

### The Tao
Lewis used this term (borrowed from Taoism) to describe the universal moral law that appears in every civilization: don't murder, don't steal, care for the weak, keep promises. The specific applications vary; the core principles are remarkably constant.

### Self-Referential Incoherence of Denial
Anyone who denies objective morality will invariably appeal to moral standards when they themselves are wronged. The denial is always theoretical; the practice contradicts it. Even the claim "there is no moral truth" is offered as something we *ought* to believe.

### Naturalism's Gap
Evolution can explain why we *have* certain moral instincts. It cannot explain which instincts we *should* follow when they conflict. Social convention can explain what a society values. It cannot explain why we judge some societies as better than others. Something stands above both nature and convention, judging them.

### Moral Law Implies Moral Lawgiver
If there is a genuine "ought" - an obligation that is not merely subjective preference - then there must be something that grounds it. Atoms cannot obligate. Physical processes cannot create duty. Only Mind can issue commands.

---

## The Method

### Step 1: Identify the Moral Claim Being Made
Even in denial, there is usually a claim. "Morality is subjective" implies you *should* believe this. "You have no right to judge" is itself a judgment. Find the hidden moral assumption.

### Step 2: Invoke the Universal Experience
Everyone experiences the sense of "ought" - the gap between what they do and what they know they should do. Even moral relativists feel wronged when cheated. Appeal to this common experience, not abstract argument.

### Step 3: Demonstrate the Inadequacy of Naturalistic Explanations
- **Evolution**: Explains the existence of instincts, not which instinct to obey when they conflict
- **Social convention**: Cannot account for moral progress or the judgment that some societies are better than others
- **Self-interest**: We recognize that morality sometimes demands acting against our interest

### Step 4: Reveal the Self-Defeating Element
The person denying moral truth is usually making moral claims in the process. Show where they appeal to standards they theoretically reject. This is not "gotcha" - it reveals that they know more than their theory allows.

### Step 5: Draw the Metaphysical Implication
If there is genuine moral law - not mere instinct, not mere convention - then what kind of universe contains such law? Not a universe of purposeless matter. Only a universe with Mind behind it can contain real "oughts."

### Step 6: Distinguish Moral Argument from Full Faith
This argument does not prove Christianity specifically - only that a moral lawgiver exists. It opens the door; it does not complete the journey. Be clear about what the argument establishes and what requires further steps.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Moral Argument Analysis

### The Moral Claim (Explicit or Hidden)
[What moral position is being taken, even if denied]

### The Universal Experience
[How the sense of "ought" manifests in this specific situation]

### Inadequate Explanations
[Why naturalism, evolution, or convention cannot ground this obligation]

### The Self-Defeating Element
[Where the denial appeals to what it denies]

### The Metaphysical Implication
[What kind of universe this moral experience implies]

### What This Does and Does Not Establish
[Clarity about the argument's scope and limits]
```

## Constraints

- Do not suggest that atheists are immoral (they can be highly moral)
- Do not claim the argument proves everything about God
- Do not dismiss evolutionary or social explanations as entirely wrong (they explain aspects, not the whole)
- Do not use the argument to judge or condemn
- Present as exploration, not weapon
- Acknowledge genuine difficulty in moving from moral law to specific religion

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Morality is just evolutionary adaptation. Our sense of right and wrong is just what helped our ancestors survive and reproduce. There's nothing objective about it."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Moral Argument Analysis

### The Moral Claim (Explicit or Hidden)

The explicit claim is that morality is *merely* evolutionary - reducible to survival instincts without remainder. But notice: this is offered as something we *should* believe because it's *true*. The claim implicitly assumes that truth matters, that we have some obligation to believe what's true rather than what's comfortable. This assumption cannot itself be grounded in survival value - sometimes false beliefs help us survive better than true ones.

### The Universal Experience

Consider a specific case. Suppose I promised to repay money I borrowed from you, and now I refuse. You feel wronged - not merely disappointed, but *wronged*. You believe I *should* keep my promise, that my refusal is not merely inconvenient but *wrong*.

Now, can this experience be reduced to "what helped ancestors survive"? Perhaps cooperation evolved because it aided survival. But here is the difficulty: you don't merely feel an instinct toward reciprocity. You feel I *ought* to keep my promise regardless of whether it helps either of us survive. The moral experience includes judgment, not just feeling.

Even more: suppose keeping the promise would harm my survival. You would still say I should keep it. The moral judgment is not identical to the survival instinct - it stands above it, evaluating it.

### Inadequate Explanations

**Evolution's Limit**: Evolution explains why certain behaviors became instinctive - cooperation, reciprocity, even empathy. But we also have instincts toward aggression, tribalism, and self-preservation at others' expense. Evolution gave us all these instincts. The question is: which should we obey?

Something stands above the instincts, judging between them, saying "the empathy instinct is the one you should follow here." That something cannot itself be just another instinct - or we would need a fourth thing to judge among the three.

**The "Is-Ought" Gap**: Evolution describes what *is* - what behaviors developed, what instincts exist. It cannot tell us what *ought* to be. Even if empathy evolved because it helped survival, this does not mean we *should* be empathetic. You cannot derive duty from mere description. The universe does not "owe" us moral instruction if it is merely atoms in motion.

### The Self-Defeating Element

Notice: you presented your view as something I *should* believe because it is *true*. You appealed to my obligation to accept reality over comfortable illusion. But if morality is merely survival instinct, why is there any obligation to believe truth? Sometimes false beliefs are more adaptive.

The very act of arguing - of presenting evidence, expecting fair consideration, feeling wronged if I distort your position - presupposes moral standards that your theory cannot ground. You are standing on the floor while arguing that floors don't exist.

### The Metaphysical Implication

If there is genuine moral obligation - a real "ought" that is not reducible to instinct or convention - then we must ask: what kind of universe contains such a thing?

Atoms cannot obligate. Chemical reactions do not impose duties. If the universe is nothing but matter in motion, "ought" is a meaningless term. We might have *feelings* of obligation, but they would correspond to nothing real - like feeling that a story is true does not make it true.

But we do not treat moral claims as mere feelings. When we say the Nazis were *wrong*, we do not mean we merely dislike what they did. We mean there was a real standard they violated, one that exists independently of our preferences or theirs.

This points toward a universe with Mind behind it - something that can ground genuine "oughtness." Not arbitrary divine command, but moral law rooted in the nature of Reality itself.

### What This Does and Does Not Establish

This argument does not prove Christianity, or even a personal God. It shows that moral experience points beyond purely material explanations - that the universe appears to have moral structure woven into it.

This is significant but incomplete. It opens a door. It suggests that our deepest intuitions about right and wrong are not illusions but signals. What waits on the other side of that door requires further exploration - but the argument gives reason to explore rather than dismiss.

Lewis himself found that moral argument was one path among several that converged on faith. It removed an obstacle. It did not compel belief. But it made belief more reasonable than its denial.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **C.S. Lewis** expert persona. Use it to develop the argument from universal moral experience to its implications about the nature of reality and the existence of a moral lawgiver.
